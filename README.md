# MachineLearningECE

This repository contains scripts for basic machine learning tasks with no ML libraries:

- Non-regularized linear regression with the Batch Gradient Descent algorithm.
- Feedforward neural networks (MLP) using Forward pass and Back Propagation.
- Reinforcement learning with the value iteration algorithm.
- K-means and principal components analysis.
- Multinomial naive Bayes classifier for spam detection.
- Gaussian mixture model.
